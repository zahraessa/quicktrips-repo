Granada	Nicaragua	Nandaime		0.00000000	The Alhambra citadel of Granada is one of the most famous buildings in Spain: a Moorish fortress with grand archways and delicate ornamental mosaics. Step backwards in time as you wind through the ascending cobblestone streets of Albayzin. You’ll be rewarded with beautiful views from the Mirador San Nicolas. Granada’s nightlife is vibrant and varied, thanks in part to its student population. Hit the bars of Calle Elvira or, for a quieter outing, the traditional tea rooms of La Calle de Las Teterias.
Maharashtra	India	Satānā		0.97609300	From the beaches of sun-soaked Goa to the frenetic bazaars of Mumbai, India offers wealth of vastly different, yet equally enthralling, experiences.

Aichi	Japan	Anjō		0.97390500	Commerce keeps Nagoya’s downtown popping with life, but there’s more than just manufacturing to this industrial powerhouse.

Latium	Italy	Monterotondo		0.00000000	From the silvery crests of the Alps to the sparkling Mediterranean Sea, Italy’s beauty is unparalleled. A visit could mean marveling at the Colosseum after a tender plate of pasta, or drifting lazily down a canal, your belly full of local Sangiovese.  Explore Tuscan vineyards and olive groves or drool over boutiques in fashionable Milan. Look for mermaids from the cliffs of Sorrento or nibble on Parma’s famous cheese and prosciutto.  Anywhere you choose, the country will captivate you.
England	United Kingdom	Leyland		0.84877000	Home to ancient market towns and iconic cities, rolling green hills and dramatic coastlines, England is the place to be.

Gharb-Chrarda-Beni Hssen	Morocco	Sidi Qacem		0.00000000	The fragrant air of Morocco seems spiked with local spices. Cradled by the dunes of the Sahara, the Kingdom has been inhabited for hundreds of thousands of years. And from the bustling Medina of Marrakech to the mosaic of leather tanning vessels in Fes, Moroccan culture is still steeped in rich tradition. The collection of blue-bottomed boats in Essaouira has become a monochromatic hallmark of the city, while the cafés of Casablanca will invoke your inner Bogie or Bergman.  
Canary Islands	Spain	Santa Brígida		0.88894600	The sun-drenched Canary Islands lie close to North Africa and have an exotic flavor of their own. Hundreds of volcanoes, rolling sand dunes, rich forests and rugged cliffs dapple these seven Atlantic gems. Catch a ferry to Lanzarote. Ride a camel through volcanic Timanfaya National Park. Take on Tenerife, home of Mount Teide, Spain's tallest peak. Romp Grand Canary's beaches or hike La Gomera's Garajonay National Park. More adventures await on tiny El Hierro, verdant La Palma and peaceful Fuerteventura.
New York	United States	Middletown		0.89390600	Conquering New York in one visit is impossible. Instead, hit the must-sees – the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art – and then explore off the beaten path with visits to The Cloisters or one of the city’s libraries. Indulge in the bohemian shops of the West Village or the fine dining of the Upper West Side. The bustling marketplace inside of Grand Central Station gives you a literal taste of the best the city has to offer.\r\n
Nakhon Ratchasima	Thailand	Nakhon Ratchasima		0.00000000	The lush jungles of Thailand promise adventure, while the serene beaches are the perfect place to splash in the sun. The Similan Islands feature some of the best dive sites in the world, where barracuda dart amid coral reefs and rock formations. Party in the nightclubs of Patong or linger over mango sticky rice at the famous Bangkok family restaurant Kao Neoo Korpanich. The city of Chiang Mai is an absolute must-visit; a mosaic of ancient temples, massage parlors, music venues, and markets.
Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie	France	Denain		0.96050500	There's much more to France than Paris—from the fairy-tale châteaux of the Loire Valley to the lavender fields of Provence, and the French Riviera's celebrity-studded beaches. World-famous gastronomy and fine wines provide the perfect complement to the country's alpine views and architectural masterpieces.
Valencia	Spain	Llíria		0.94406200	You’ll find plenty of orange trees here, but the fruit known as the "Valencia orange" was actually developed in California. Travelers interested in local food should focus on paella instead. While the city contains many monuments, Valencia’s modern crown jewel is the City of Arts and Sciences, a futuristic complex of museums, cinemas, theaters, and more.
Cundinamarca	Colombia	Girardot City		0.00000000	Cartagena, a gorgeous fishing village on Colombia's Caribbean coast, has excellent beaches, a historic old town (that's entirely walkable) and beautiful colonial architecture. It's also one of the safest places in the country, so it's no wonder it's a popular port of call for cruise ships. Need a break from exploring the cobblestone streets? Stop at an outdoor cafe for excellent pastries and people-watching.
Wilāyat-e Baghlān	Afghanistan	Pul-e Khumrī		0.84590936	Like all of the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Thomas has plenty of opportunities to lounge on the beach, splash in the sea, or amp it up with watersports. It also boasts a bountiful duty-free shopping scene – just be prepared to brave the cruise ship crowds. Charlotte Amalie swells with Danish colonial architecture and pirate legend. Shiver ye timbers at Blackbeard’s Castle, then work up an appetite by climbing the historic 99 Steps, constructed from the ballast bricks of 18th century Danish ships. 
Andalusia	Spain	Mairena del Alcor		0.75644300	From sun-drenched archipelagos and bustling urban cities to snowcapped mountains and semi-arid deserts, Spain epitomizes geographical diversity.

Georgia	United States	Riverdale		-0.00873000	While Atlanta is the anchor and capital of Georgia, you can aim in any direction to find distinctly different regions – from the tail of the Appalachians in the North to the rolling Piedmont hills and on down to the seaside marshes in the East. Atlanta lays claim to the state’s number one attraction – Stone Mountain State Park. They say it best - “Serious fun. Endless adventure.” Just 15 minutes from downtown, the world’s largest exposed granite dome is surrounded by 3,200 acres of natural beauty and stimulating activities for every member of the family – sky rides and hiking paths, laser shows and pedal boats along Stone Mountain Lake. Golfers tee it up, while red foxes dash across the fairways in a state where the Masters Golf Tournament creates revered green-jacket memories every year. It’s a long downhill ride down to historic Savannah, a ‘stone’s throw’ from the Atlantic and a virtual step back in time to Southern architecture and stately squares. St. Simon’s and Jekyll Islands offer barrier island beauty and a wonderful combination of outdoor activities, historic sites and artistic culture. Originally the private winter playground of wealthy northeasterners, Jekyll Island stretches along 10 miles of coastal beaches and inland marshes. Cycling and walking paths wind under moss-laden oaks, and a tour of Millionaire Village takes you back to those Cornelius Vanderbilt and J.P. Morgan days. The kid-friendly Summer Waves Water Park adds man-made fun to natural water sport activities. Coastal golf courses and sophisticated St. Simon’s Island appeal to moms, dads and vacationing couples.
Victoria	Australia	Epping		0.00000000	Victoria is a thriving city of heritage architecture and time-honored traditions like afternoon tea. With the ocean at its doorstep and wilderness in its backyard, it’s also a perfect place for outdoor enthusiasts.

Madrid	Spain	Aranjuez		0.84734230	So many of Madrid’s buildings look like castles, you’ll think you’ve stumbled into a fairytale.

Oklahoma	United States	Duncan		0.95237600	With hundreds of man-made lakes, state parks, casinos, museums and nightlife and dining opportunities in revitalized downtown areas in Oklahoma City and Tulsa, there is a lot to see and do in the Sooner State.

Some of the state’s most popular lakes include Broken Bow Lake located near the Quachita Mountains; Grand Lake in the northeastern corner of the state at the foothills of the Ozark Mountains and Lake Murray in the hills in the southern part of the state.\r\nWhile the state is known for its many outdoor activities like great fishing, golf, hiking, canoeing and boating, make sure you don’t overlook its fantastic museums.

Kharkiv’s top attractions include its zoo, its history museum, Freedom (Svoboda) Square and the Holy Shroud Cathedral.
Kaliningrad	Russia	Svetlyy		0.98719200	A little extra chunk of Russia stuck between Lithuania and Poland on the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad was known as Königsberg from its founding by the Teutonic Knights in the 13th century until after World War II. It was renamed, repopulated with Russians and became part of the Soviet Union. Today, as it has been for centuries, it’s known for amber products, with most of the world’s harvestable amber still lying off its coast.

In 1905, it was the site of a major Russian Revolution uprising by crew members of the Battleship Potemkin. The nice old town area has a beautiful opera house, and the city has many great beaches.
Abu Dhabi	United Arab Emirates	Al Ain		0.89207600	Atmospheric backstreets paint a very different picture to first impressions of Abu Dhabi. The often slick and modern capital of the U.A.E. presents a fascinating mixture of tradition and progression. Tracing its rich history back to around 3000 B.C., Abu Dhabi maintains a more distinctly Arabian ambiance than glitzy Dubai. Taxis are a safe, reliable way to get around sites such as The Corniche Park, the White Fort, the Heritage Village, which offers glimpses into Bedouin life, and the Women's Craft Centre. 
New Jersey	United States	West New York		0.00000000	Whether you are looking for sun-drenched beaches or outdoor activities in beautiful countryside, New Jersey has plenty to offer.

But the city's biggest tourist draw is a nine-hour historic train ride in a vintage steam locomotive. The Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad, which hauled precious metals in the 1880s, now takes tourists for a 47-mile, open-air journey through mountains and forests and past abandoned mines to historic Silverton and back. Children and train buffs will relish the chance to climb into a locomotive and pore over railroad memorabilia at the railroad's museum.

Annaba	Algeria	El Hadjar		0.00000000	Diverse marine life and hundreds of Red Sea coral reef sites make Sharm El Sheikh a magnet for divers and eco-tourists. The tourist economy of this Sinai Peninsula city has grown quite rapidly over the last few decades, resulting in an upcrop of first-class resorts and posh nightlife.

Adana	Turkey	Ceyhan		0.00000000	Traffic-locked boulevards, industrial suburbs, and modern shopping malls are exactly what you’d expect from one of Turkey’s largest cities—and Adana doesn't fall short.

194	Nord-Pas-de-Calais-Picardie	There's much more to France than Paris—from the fairy-tale châteaux of the Loire Valley to the lavender fields of Provence, and the French Riviera's celebrity-studded beaches. World-famous gastronomy and fine wines provide the perfect complement to the country's alpine views and architectural masterpieces.	13				0
195	Valencia	You’ll find plenty of orange trees here, but the fruit known as the "Valencia orange" was actually developed in California. Travelers interested in local food should focus on paella instead. While the city contains many monuments, Valencia’s modern crown jewel is the City of Arts and Sciences, a futuristic complex of museums, cinemas, theaters, and more.	13				0
196	Kalmar	A great place to visit	14				0
197	Maharashtra	From the beaches of sun-soaked Goa to the frenetic bazaars of Mumbai, India offers wealth of vastly different, yet equally enthralling, experiences. Explore the sparkling lakes and palaces of Udaipur, watch traditional Indian dance in Kochi, or buy brilliantly-colored silk saris at a market in Varanasi… no matter how much you travel in India, you’ll always find more to discover in this vibrant, fascinating country.	14				0
198	Aichi	Commerce keeps Nagoya’s downtown popping with life, but there’s more than just manufacturing to this industrial powerhouse. Nagoyans meet for plates of crisp-friend miso katsu; make weekend trips to nearby Shinto shrines; and count down the days to the city’s autumn Nagoya Festival.	14				0
199	England	Home to ancient market towns and iconic cities, rolling green hills and dramatic coastlines, England is the place to be. Soak up the cosmopolitan vibe of Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol; be captivated by ancient legends in medieval York and the spa city of Bath; and explore England’s largest National Park (the Lake District) or Dorset’s majestic Jurassic Coast. Get up-close-and-personal with royalty in Windsor, explore the castles of Kent, or wander the hallowed halls of Oxford University.	14				0
200	Canary Islands	The sun-drenched Canary Islands lie close to North Africa and have an exotic flavor of their own. Hundreds of volcanoes, rolling sand dunes, rich forests and rugged cliffs dapple these seven Atlantic gems. Catch a ferry to Lanzarote. Ride a camel through volcanic Timanfaya National Park. Take on Tenerife, home of Mount Teide, Spain's tallest peak. Romp Grand Canary's beaches or hike La Gomera's Garajonay National Park. More adventures await on tiny El Hierro, verdant La Palma and peaceful Fuerteventura.	14				0
201	New York	Conquering New York in one visit is impossible. Instead, hit the must-sees – the Empire State Building, the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art – and then explore off the beaten path with visits to The Cloisters or one of the city’s libraries. Indulge in the bohemian shops of the West Village or the fine dining of the Upper West Side.
